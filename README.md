## Objective
This project is inspired by the "100 Days of Code" course by Dr. Angela Yu and aims to create a bot that automates swiping on the Bumble dating platform. The goal is to streamline the swiping process and interact with user profiles.

## Bot Workflow
1. **Access Bumble:** The bot initiates by navigating to the Bumble website at "https://bumble.com/app."
2. **Authentication:** The user is prompted to log in using Facebook credentials.
3. **Pop-Up Window:** Upon successful login, the bot proceeds to the next window, which opens as a pop-up, displaying web profiles of potential matches.
4. **Automated Swiping:** The bot's primary task is to identify the "Match" button and simulate clicks. In this project, it's set to perform this action 100 times, effectively automating the swiping process.

## Technology Stack
- **Selenium:** The bot is developed using Selenium, a widely-used web automation framework.
- **Web Automation:** Selenium interacts with web elements, replicating user actions.
- **Python:** The bot is scripted in Python, leveraging its capabilities for automation.

## Purpose
This bot simplifies the process of swiping through Bumble profiles by automating the repetitive task of clicking the "Match" button. It allows users to expedite the swiping process and potentially save time.

## Note
Please note that while automation can enhance efficiency, it's essential to use automation tools and bots responsibly and in accordance with the platform's terms of service.

This project demonstrates the application of web automation and bot development using Selenium for a specific use case â€“ automating swiping on a dating platform.
